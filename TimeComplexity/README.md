###Tasks:
- Task1: Devise an experiment to verify that the list index operator is O(1)O(1)
- Task2:  Devise an experiment to verify that get item and set item are O(1)O(1) for dictionaries.
- Task3: Devise an experiment that compares the performance of the del operator on lists and dictionaries.
- Task4: Given a list of numbers in random order, write an algorithm that works in O(nlog(n))O(nlog‚Å°(n)) to find the kth smallest number in the list.
- Task5: Can you improve the algorithm from the previous problem to be linear? Explain.
